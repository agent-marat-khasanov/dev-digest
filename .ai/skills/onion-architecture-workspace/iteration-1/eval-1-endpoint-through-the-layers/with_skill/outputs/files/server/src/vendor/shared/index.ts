 *  - contracts/platform   Settings, ConnTestResult, Repo, PrMeta/PrDetail, ContextDoc, …
 *  - contracts/repo-stats RepoStats (GET /repos/:repoId/stats — 30-day rollup)
 *  - adapters             adapter interfaces + ModelInfo
 *
 * Feature agents (A1–A6) and F2 import everything from here. The barrel is
 * stable — feature agents EXTEND with new files, they do not edit existing ones.
